              <h2>How To Skate! Tha Gear & The Ollie</h2>
              <p>
                If you're serious about skating, something you'll want to invest
                in is the right "gear". You'll of course first need a skateboard.
                Any 8.5 x 11 inch skateboard should do, and can be found relatively
                cheaply. I also recommend a tightening tool for the trucks of the
                skateboard, as this will help you find footing you're comfortable with
                when you're just starting out. Bearing this in mind, balancing on a
                skateboard is no easy task, and you WILL fall off when beginning.
                This is why it's important to have some light protective gear and
                an ability to catch yourself. Invest in some elbow and knee pads, and
                eventually a helmet. These are important for once you really start 
                moving on your board. Once you've done this, work on just getting on
                and staying on your board.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now that you can stay on your board, you'll want to begin learning
               stationary tricks. The most important of which is the ollie, which
               is illustrated in the following image (ignore that he has no gear,
               I assume he's pretty experienced). Start by standing on your skateboard 
               with your dominant foot at the tail and your other foot at the nose. 
               Adjust your feet according to what feels comfortable for you. Bend 
               your knees slightly and crouch down, keeping your weight centered 
               over the board. Now, look down at the ground and focus on a point in 
               front of you. Snap your back foot downward, using the tail of the board 
               as a pivot point. This will make the board pop up into the air. As the 
               board is popping up, bring your front foot forward, keeping it close to 
               the nose of the board. Keep your arms out for balance and your eyes on 
               the horizon. Once you’ve reached the apex of the jump, bring your front 
               foot back to its original position and prepare to land smoothly.

                <h2>How To Skate! Moving</h2>
                <p>
                    Now that we've established standing, we'll MOVE on to moving.
                    Choosing Your Stance: It’s essential to find a comfortable stance 
                    that feels natural for you. You can experiment with both regular 
                    and goofy stances to see which one works best for you. Placing 
                    Your Feet: Once you’ve chosen your stance, place your dominant 
                    foot at the front of the skateboard just behind the front trucks, 
                    with the tip of your shoe at a 45-degree angle and over the bolts. 
                    Your back foot should be at the back of the board, with your heel
                    slightly raised and your toes pointing downwards. Pushing: To start 
                    moving, you’ll need to push off with one foot. Place your back foot 
                    on the ground and push off with your back foot to gain speed. As you 
                    start moving, bring your front foot back onto the board and balance 
                    yourself. Balancing: Keep your knees bent and your weight centered over 
                    the board. Look ahead and focus on a point in front of you to maintain 
                    balance. Keep your arms out for balance and to help you steer. Turning: 
                    To turn, lean your body in the direction you want to go and apply pressure 
                    to the foot corresponding to the direction you want to turn. For example, 
                    to turn left, lean your body to the left and apply pressure to your left 
                    foot. Stopping: To stop, apply gentle pressure to the tail of the board 
                    with your back foot. You can also use your front foot to apply gentle 
                    pressure to the nose of the board to slow down. Practice: Remember, practice 
                    makes perfect! Start in a flat, open area and get comfortable with the basics 
                    before moving to more challenging terrain. With time and practice, you’ll be 
                    carving up the streets in no time!
