              <h2>About the developer... me!</h2>
              <p>
                Hello! I'm Jacob, the developer of this here website. Here's a somewhat silly
                picture of me before skating from a while back. I got into skateboarding
                in October of 2023 at the "behest of a friend of mine" and have enjoyed it 
                ever since. In reality, I did it to impress a girl (still not sure if 
                it worked). And though my reasons may be silly or seem like a poor foundation,
                it ironically catapulted me into what I discovered to be one of my favorite
                pastimes.
                </p>
                <p>
                Regrettably, I haven't found much time to do so lately, but
                that's a-ok. Further, I am not the craziest or gnarliest skater, but those
                traits aren't imperative for the mission of this site. I just want to show
                that if I can skate, anybody can. 

                Some other fun facts about me: my favorite band is Killswitch Engage, I am
                a Roman Catholic, I like to run, and I think mint chocolate chip ice cream is
                only good when it's green. Thank you for reading, and skate on!
              </p>
